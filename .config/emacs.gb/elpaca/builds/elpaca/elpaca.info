Elpaca User Manual
******************

Elpaca is an elisp package manager.  It allows users to find, install,
update, and remove third-party packages for Emacs.  It is a replacement
for the built-in Emacs package manager, package.el.

1.1 Requirements
================

Elpaca requires:
   • Emacs >= 27.1
   • git (minimum version TBD)


File: elpaca.info,  Node: Installer,  Prev: Requirements,  Up: Installation

1.2 Installer
=============

To install Elpaca, add the following elisp to your init.el.  It must
come before any calls to other Elpaca functions/macros.  This will clone
Elpaca into your ‘user-emacs-directory’ under the ‘elpaca’ subdirectory.
It then builds and activates Elpaca.

     (defvar elpaca-installer-version 0.5)
     (defvar elpaca-directory (expand-file-name "elpaca/" user-emacs-directory))
     (defvar elpaca-builds-directory (expand-file-name "builds/" elpaca-directory))
     (defvar elpaca-repos-directory (expand-file-name "repos/" elpaca-directory))
     (defvar elpaca-order '(elpaca :repo "https://github.com/progfolio/elpaca.git"
                                   :ref nil
                                   :files (:defaults (:exclude "extensions"))
                                   :build (:not elpaca--activate-package)))
     (let* ((repo  (expand-file-name "elpaca/" elpaca-repos-directory))
            (build (expand-file-name "elpaca/" elpaca-builds-directory))

               (error "%s" (with-current-buffer buffer (buffer-string))))

   • Windows users must be able to create symlinks(1), or enable
     ‘elpaca-no-symlink-mode’

     ;; Uncomment for systems which cannot create symlinks:
     ;; (elpaca-no-symlink-mode)

   You’ll also want to disable package.el in your early-init file(2):

     (setq package-enable-at-startup nil)

   And remove anything related to package.el in your init file.  e.g.
calls to ‘(package-activate-all)’.

2.1 Quick Start
===============

Operation                               UI (keys apply in elpaca-ui-mode)    completing-read interface commands
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Finding Packages                        ‘M-x elpaca-manager’                 ‘elpaca-try’
Trying Packages (for current session)   ‘i’ ‘x’                              ‘elpaca-try’
Updating Packages                       ‘u’ ‘x’                              ‘elpaca-update’ or ‘M-x’ ‘elpaca-update-all’
Rebuilding Packages                     ‘r’ ‘x’                              ‘elpaca-rebuild’
Deleting Packages                       ‘d’ ‘x’                              ‘elpaca-delete’
View Package Logs                       ‘l’ filters log to current package   ‘elpaca-log’
View Package Statuses                   ‘t’ show most recent log entries     ‘elpaca-status’
Visit Package Repository Directory      ‘v’                                  ‘elpaca-visit’
Visit Package Build Directory           ‘C-u’ ‘v’                            ‘C-u’ ‘elpaca-visit’
Browse Package Website                  ‘b’                                  ‘elpaca-browse’

   Packages installed via the above commands are not loaded on
subsequent Emacs sessions (after restarting).  To install and load
packages persistently (across Emacs restarts), use the ‘elpaca’ macro in
your init file after the installer.  (*note installer: Installer.)

   For example:

     ;; Install use-package support
     (elpaca elpaca-use-package
       ;; Enable :elpaca use-package keyword.
       (elpaca-use-package-mode)
       ;; Assume :elpaca t unless otherwise specified.
       (setq elpaca-use-package-by-default t))

     ;; Block until current queue processed.
     (elpaca-wait)

     ;;When installing a package which modifies a form used at the top-level
     ;;(e.g. a package which adds a use-package key word),
     ;;use `elpaca-wait' to block until that package has been installed/configured.
     ;;For example:
     ;;(use-package general :demand t)
     ;;(elpaca-wait)

     ;; Expands to: (elpaca evil (use-package evil :demand t))
     (use-package evil :demand t)

     ;;Turns off elpaca-use-package-mode current declartion
     ;;Note this will cause the declaration to be interpreted immediately (not deferred).
     ;;Useful for configuring built-in emacs features.
     (use-package emacs :elpaca nil :config (setq ring-bell-function #'ignore))

     ;; Don't install anything. Defer execution of BODY
     (elpaca nil (message "deferred"))

   *IMPORTANT*:

   Elpaca installs and activates packages asynchronously.  Elpaca
processes its package queues _after_ Emacs reads the init file.(1)
Consider the following example:

     (elpaca nil (message "First")) ; Queue First
     (message "Second") ; Second messaged
     (elpaca nil (message "Third")) ; Queue Third
     (elpaca-process-queues) ; Process queue: First messaged, Third messaged.

   “Second” will be message _before_ “First” and “Third”.  Defer forms
which are dependent on deferred forms.  Wrapping the “Second” message in
an ‘elpaca’ declaration will fix the above example:

     (elpaca nil (message "First"))  ; Queue First
     (elpaca nil (message "Second")) ; Queue Second
     (elpaca nil (message "Third"))  ; Queue Third
     (elpaca-process-queues) ; Process queue: First, Second, Third messaged.

   Add any configuration which relies on ‘after-init-hook’,
‘emacs-startup-hook’, etc to ‘elpaca-after-init-hook’ so it runs after
Elpaca has activated all queued packages.  This includes loading of
saved customizations.  e.g.

     (setq custom-file (expand-file-name "customs.el" user-emacs-directory))
     (add-hook 'elpaca-after-init-hook (lambda () (load custom-file 'noerror)))

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) This is so Elpaca can build a proper dependency tree.  It ensures
packages the user explicitly requests are not preempted by dependencies
of other packages.

2.2 Basic concepts
==================

The ‘elpaca-example’ macro in the following examples reduces verbosity.
It is not part of Elpaca.

     (defun elpaca-example-sort-plist (plist)
       "Return copy of PLIST with :package followed by lexically sorted key/val pairs."
       `(:package ,(plist-get plist :package)
                  ,@(cl-loop for k in (cl-sort (cl-loop for key in plist by #'cddr
                                                        unless (eq key :package) collect key)
                                               #'string< :key #'symbol-name)
                             append (list k (plist-get plist k)))))

     (defmacro elpaca-example (&rest body)
       "Execute BODY with a clean elpaca environment."
       `(let (elpaca-cache-menu-items
              elpaca-order-functions
              elpaca-recipe-functions
              (elpaca-menu-functions '(elpaca-example-menu)))
          (elpaca-example-sort-plist ,@body)))

   Examples will use the following recipe menu.  (*note recipe menu:
Menus.) It offers a “burger” package recipe:

     (defun elpaca-example-menu (_)
       '((burger . (:recipe ( :buns 2
                              :lettuce t
                              :tomato t
                              :beef t
                              :cheese t
                              :cook well-done
                              :from elpaca-example-menu)))))

File: elpaca.info,  Node: Recipes,  Next: Menus,  Up: Basic concepts

2.2.1 Recipes
-------------

A recipe provides Elpaca with the metadata necessary to build and
install a package.  It is a list of the form:

     (ITEM . PROPS)

   _ITEM_ is a symbol uniquely identifying the package.  _PROPS_ is a
plist with any of the following recipe keywords:

:host | :fetcher
     A symbol or string representing the hosting service of the
     repository.

     (example :host github)
     (example :fetcher gitlab)
     (example :host "www.example.com")

:repo
     A string of the form ‘USER/REPO’ when used with the ‘:host’
     keyword; a local file path or remote URL when ‘:host’ is not used.

     (example :host github :repo "user/example") ;;downloaded from github

     (local :repo "~/repos/local/") ;;cloned from local filesystem

     (remote :repo "https://foo.example/example.git") ;;remote clone

:branch
     The repository branch to check out when installing the package.

     (example :host github :repo "user/example" :branch "main")

:tag
     The tag to check out when installing the package.

     (example :host github :repo "user/example" :tag "v1.0")

:ref
     The git ref(1) to check out when installing the package.

     (example :host github :repo "user/example" :ref "a76ca0a") ;; Check out a specific commit.

:pin
     When non-nil, ignore the package during update commands.

     (example :pin t)

:depth
     The package repository’s history depth.

     (example :depth 1) ;; Shallow clone with history truncated to 1 commit.
     (example :depth nil) ;; Full repository clone.

:files
     The files linked from the package’s repository to its build
     directory.

     Each element of the list is either:
        • The symbol ‘:defaults’, which expands to
          ‘elpaca-default-files-directive’.
        • A string naming files or folders.  Shell glob patterns may be
          used to match multiple files.
        • A list starting with the ‘:exclude’ keyword.  The remaining
          elements are not linked.

     (example :files (:defaults "extensions/*")) ;; Link everything in the extensions folder.
     (example :files (:defaults (:exclude "*.c"))) ;; Exclude all files with the "c" file extension.

:protocol
     The protocol to use when cloning repositories.

   The value must be a symbol, either ‘https’ or ‘ssh’.

     (example :protocol https) ; Use the https protocol.
     (example :protocol ssh) ; Use the ssh protocol.

:remotes
     Configures the repository remotes(2).

   The value must be a single remote spec or a list of remote specs.
The first remote given will have its ref checked out when cloning the
repository.  A spec may be a string to rename the default remote.  The
following will rename the cloned remote (usually “origin” by git
convention) to “upstream”:

     (example :remotes "upstream")

   In order to add a another remote, a spec may be a list of the form:

     ("NAME" [PROPS])

   _NAME_ is a string indicating the name of the remote.  _PROPS_ is an
optional plist used to override inherited recipe keywords.

   For example:

     (example :host github :repo "upstream/example"
              :remotes ("fork" :repo "fork/zenburn-emacs"))

   Will add a remote named fork which points to a repository hosted on
the same forge as the upstream remote.  The following does the same
above, additionally adding a third remote at a different forge.

     (example :host github :repo "upstream/example"
              :remotes (("fork" :repo "fork/zenburn-emacs") ; :host github inherited from above
                        ("other" :host gitlab :repo "other/zenburn-emacs")))

:main
     The name of the main elisp file.  When provided this can speed up
     the process of cloning and loading a package’s dependencies.  When
     declared ‘nil’, skip dependency check.

     (example :main "example.el")

     (example :main nil)

:build
     A list of build steps, nil or t.  To remove steps from
     ‘elpaca-default-build-steps’ by starting the list with the ‘:not’
     keyword.

     (example :build (:not elpaca--byte-compile))

:inherit
     When non-nil, inherit _PROPS_ from ‘elpaca-order-functions’ and
     possibly ‘elpaca-menu-functions’.  For example, without
     inheritance:

     (elpaca-example (elpaca-recipe '(burger :inherit nil)))

   returns the recipe as declared:

     (:package "burger" :inherit nil)

   With inheritance enabled:

     (elpaca-example (elpaca-recipe '(burger :inherit t)))

   the elpaca-example-menu provides the rest of the “burger” recipe.

     (:package "burger" :inherit t)

:pre-build
     Commands and/or elisp evaluated prior to ‘:build’ steps.
   Each command is either an elisp form or a list of strings executed in
a shell context of the form:

     ("executable" "argument"...)

   For example:

     (elpaca (example :pre-build (("configure") ("make" "install"))))

:post-build
     The same as ‘:pre-build’, but run just before activating a package.

     (elpaca (example :post-build (message "activate next")))

:autoloads
     The name of the file the package’s autoload file.  When ‘nil’,
     autoload loading and generation are disabled for the package.  When
     ‘t’, the default autoload file is generated/loaded
     (‘PACKAGE-NAME-autoloads.el’).  The value may also be a string
     which is expanded relative to the package’s build directory.  e.g.
     ‘"org-loaddefs.el"’.

  1. Inheritance precedence

     The following list shows the order of precedence for inheritance.
     Each item takes precedence over the items which follow it.

        • elpaca-recipe-functions
        • declared recipe
        • elpaca-order-functions
        • elpaca-menu-functions

          (elpaca-example
           (let ((elpaca-recipe-functions (lambda (recipe) '(:from recipe-functions :cheese extra)))
                 (elpaca-order-functions (lambda (order) '(:from order-functions :tomato nil))))
             (elpaca-recipe '(burger))))

          (:package "burger" :cheese extra :from recipe-functions :tomato nil)

  2. elpaca-recipe-functions

     The abnormal hook ‘elpaca-recipe-functions’ runs via
     ‘run-hook-with-args-until-success’ just before installing the
     package.  Each function in the list should accept the current
     recipe as its sole argument and return either nil or a plist.  The
     first function to return a plist has its return value merged with
     the current recipe.

     This is useful if you want to guarantee the values of certain
     keywords despite allowing recipe inheritance.

          (elpaca-example
           (let ((elpaca-recipe-functions
                  '((lambda (recipe)
                      "If a recipe calls for cheese, I always want extra."
                      (when (plist-get recipe :cheese) (list :cheese 'extra))))))
             (elpaca-recipe '(burger))))

          (:package "burger")

2.2.2 Menus
-----------

A menu is a function which returns an alist of the form:
     ((ITEM . DATA)...)

   _ITEM_ is a symbol uniquely identifying a package.  _DATA_ is a plist
of package metadata.  _DATA_ must contain the following keywords:

:recipe
     A package recipe.  (*note recipe: Recipes.)
:source
     A string naming the menu.

   It may also provide additional information about a package.  For
example, the Elpaca UI utilizes the following keywords when present:

:url
     The package’s website URL.
:description
     A description of the package.
:date 
     The time of package’s last update.

   The function must accept one of the following _REQUEST_ symbols as an
argument:

index
     Return the alist described above
update
     update the menu’s alist.

     (defun elpaca-menu-minimal (request_)
       "A minimal menu example.
     Ignore REQUEST, as this is a static, curated list of packages."
       '((example :source "EXAMPLE" :recipe (example :host github :repo "user/example"))
         (two :source "EXAMPLE" :recipe (two :host gitlab :repo "user/two"))))

   Menus allow one to offer Elpaca users curated lists of package
recipes.  For example, melpulls
(https://www.github.com/progfolio/melpulls) implements an Elpaca menu
for pending MELPA packages.

  1. elpaca-menu-functions

     The ‘elpaca-menu-functions’ variable contains menu functions for
     the following package sources by default:

        • MELPA (https://www.github.com/melpa/melpa)
        • Org (https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs/org-mode.git/)
        • Org-contrib (https://git.sr.ht/~bzg/org-contrib)

2.2.3 Orders
------------

At a minimum, an order is a symbol which represents the name of a menu
item (*note menu: Menus.):

     (elpaca example)

   An order may also be a partial or full recipe:

     (elpaca (example :host gitlab))
     (elpaca (example :host gitlab :repo "user/example" :inherit nil))

  1. elpaca-order-functions

     The abnormal hook ‘elpaca-order-functions’ runs via
     ‘run-hook-with-args-until-success’ before ‘elpaca-menu-functions’.
     Each function in the list should accept the current order as its
     sole argument and return either nil or a plist.  The first function
     to return a plist has its return value merged with the current
     order.

     This is useful for declaring default order properties.  For
     example, the following function disables recipe inheritance by
     default:

          (elpaca-example
           (let ((elpaca-order-functions '((lambda (_) '(:inherit nil)))))
             (elpaca-recipe 'burger)))

          (:package "burger" :inherit nil)

2.2.4 Queues
------------

Elpaca installs packages asynchronously.  Orders (*note orders: Orders.)
are automatically queued in a list.  When all of a queues orders have
either finished or failed Elpaca considers it “processed”.

   Queues ensure packages installation, activation, and configuration
take place prior to packages in other queues.  The ‘elpaca-queue’ macro
wraps calls to ‘elpaca’.  It places orders in its _BODY_ in their own
queue.  This is especially useful when one wants to install a package to
use later on in their init file.  For example, a package which
implements an Elpaca menu (*note menu: Menus.):

     (elpaca-queue
      (elpaca (melpulls :host github :repo "progfolio/melpulls")
        (add-to-list 'elpaca-menu-functions #'melpulls)
        (elpaca-update-menus #'melpulls)))
     ;; Implicitly queued into a new queue.
     (elpaca menu-item-available-in-melpulls)


File: elpaca.info,  Node: Installing Packages,  Prev: Queues,  Up: Basic concepts

2.2.5 Installing Packages
-------------------------

elpaca
     ‘(order &rest body)’
   Installs _ORDER_ (*note orders: Orders.) and executes _BODY_ after
processing ORDER’s queue (*note queue: Queues.).

   This macro is for programmatic use in one’s init file.  Any of the
following will install the “example” package:

     (elpaca example) ;; recipe looked up in `elpaca-menu-functions'.

     (elpaca example (message "Messaged after the order's queue has processed."))

     (elpaca (example :host github :repo "user/example"))

     (elpaca `(example :host github :repo "user/example"
                       ,@(when (eq system-type 'darwin) ;; backqouting supported
                           (list :pre-build ((message "Mac specific pre-build"))))))

   If _ORDER_ is nil, _BODY_ is still executed after processing the
current queue.

     (elpaca first (message "First configured"))
     ;; If this weren't wrapped in an `elpaca' call, it would execute FIRST
     ;; Due to the "first" and "third" package installing asynchronously.
     (elpaca nil (message "Second"))
     (elpaca third (message "Third configured"))

   Interactively evaluating an ‘elpaca’ declaration will re-process the
order.  This can be used to change a package’s recipe prior to
rebuilding it.  Note that rebuilding a package does not *reload* a
package.  It’s best to restart Emacs after a successful rebuild if you
wish to have the changes loaded.


File: elpaca.info,  Node: use-package Integration,  Prev: Basic concepts,  Up: Usage

2.3 use-package Integration
===========================

Adding the following elisp to your init file will enable Elpaca’s
optional integration with the use-package configuration macro:

     (elpaca elpaca-use-package
       ;; Enable :elpaca use-package keyword.
       (elpaca-use-package-mode)
       ;; Assume :elpaca t unless otherwise specified.
       (setq elpaca-use-package-by-default t))

     ;; Necessary to use the `:elpaca' use-package keyword at the top-level.
     (elpaca-wait)

     (use-package example)

   Expands to:

     (elpaca example (use-package example))

   The ‘:elpaca’ use-package keyword can also accept a recipe

     (use-package example :elpaca (:host host :repo "user/repo"))

   Expands to:

     (elpaca (example :host host :repo "user/repo")
       (use-package example))

   When installing a package which modifies a form used at the top-level
(e.g.  a package which adds a use-package key word), use ‘elpaca-wait’
to block until that package has been installed and configured.  For
example:

     (use-package general :demand t)
     (elpaca-wait)
     ;; use-package declarations beyond this point may use the `:general' use-package keyword.

   In order to turn off ‘elpaca-use-package-mode’ for a given
delcaration, specify ‘:elpaca nil’:

     ;; `emacs' is a pseudo-feature which can to configure built-in functionality.
     (use-package emacs :elpaca nil :config (setq ring-bell-function #'ignore))

   Note this will cause the declaration to be interpreted immediately
(not deferred).

elpaca-ui-execute-marks      x         Execute each mark in ‘elpaca-ui-marked-packages’.

 -- Function: elpaca-manager
     Display packages registered with Elpaca.  Packages can searched
     for, installed, updated, rebuilt, and deleted from this interface.
     When ‘RECACHE’ is non-nil, via lisp or interactively via the
     ‘universal-argument’, recompute Elpaca’s menu item cache before
     display.

 -- Function: elpaca-log
     Display the log for queued packages filtered by ‘QUERY’.  For
     acceptable values for ‘QUERY’ see *note searching: Searching.

 -- Function: elpaca-status
     Display the log for the most recent events for queued packages.
     This allows one to quickly determine the status and reason for the
     status of each queued package.

3.1 Searching
=============

The ‘elpaca-ui-search’ command (‘s’) prompts the user for a search query
in the minibuffer.  Altering the query updates the UI table.  Calling
with a ‘universal-argument’ (‘C-u’) populates the minibuffer with the
current search query for editing.  Setting the query to an empty string
resets the query to ‘elpaca-ui-default-query’.  The buffer’s header line
displays the current query.

   Queries are regular expressions checked against each row of the UI
table.  For example, ‘test’ will match any row which contains the string
“test”.  Some characters change the matching behavior in queries.

   The pipe character, ‘|’, will delimit text searches to specific
columns of the table.  Considering the following table:

number   A       B       C
-----------------------------
1        one     two     3
2        four    five    6
3        seven   eight   9

   The query ‘o’ will match rows 1 (on ‘one’) and 2 (on ‘four’).  The
query ‘3|’ will only search for ‘3’ in the first column and match row
three.  While ‘|||3’ Will search for ‘3’ in the 4th column of the table
and match row 1.

   The pound (a.k.a.  hash) character, ‘#’, followed by the name of a
search tag filters table entries.  For example ‘#random’ will display 10
random entries.  If the search tag accepts arguments they may passed by
wrapping the tag name in parenthesis.  e.g.  ‘#(random 20)’ will display
20 random entries.

3.2 Search tags
===============

 -- User Option: elpaca-ui-search-tags
     An alist of with elements of the form (NAME .  FILTER). ‘NAME’ is a
     unique symbol describing the filter function.  The user types name
     after ‘#’ in the minibuffer to apply the filter.  ‘FILTER’ is a
     function which must accept a list of ‘tabulated-list-entries’ as
     its first argument.  It may accept additional, optional arguments.
     The function must return a list of ‘tabulated-list-entries’.

     For example, the following search tag will embolden the first
     column of the ‘elpaca-manager’ table when the search query contains
     ‘#bold-names’:

     (defun +elpaca-bold-names (entries)
       (cl-loop for entry in entries
                for copy = (copy-tree entry)
                for cols = (cadr copy)
                for name = (aref cols 0)
                do (setf (aref cols 0) (propertize name 'face '(:weight bold)))
                collect copy))

     (cl-pushnew (cons 'bold-names #'+elpaca-bold-names) elpaca-ui-search-tags)
